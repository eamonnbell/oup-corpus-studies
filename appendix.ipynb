I know you and your friends are quite musical, so I wanted to give you first dibs on our string quartets.\" By the time finally made it, the shelves were all but empty: first dibs, indeed. Probably should have paid those fines.  The sounds of Mozart, Beethoven, and Bartók filled the corridors. Only the collected string quartets of Haydn remained. I grabbed as much music as I could and set out to form an impromptu quartet. Many of my friends are fine violinists, certainly better than I am. But most of the department's resident violists were busy exercising themselves on the , and I thought, if we started with Haydn quartets with more achievable viola parts, I could masquerade as a violist for the best part of an afternoon. We'll warm up on the easier movements, I thought, so I decided to rank each one of the quartets' third movements by their difficulty for the violist based on the proportion of notes that lie on the A string or above (>= A4). I was also faintly curious as to whether difficulty of the viola parts thus measured (however imperfectly) was correlated with the approximate order of publication for each movement. Naturally, I took out my laptop..."},{"metadata":{},"id":"extensive-connecticut","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Preliminaries"},{"metadata":{},"id":"smoking-mouth","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Humdrum"},{"metadata":{},"id":"amateur-football","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Conveniently, I have a folder full of `.krn` files, each corresponding to a movement of a string quartet by Haydn.

Though this representation is useful for input and proofreading, it is not suitable for comparing pitch height. Humdrum provides several tools for converting pitch from one representation to another. For example, the `semits` command converts pitch data into semitones above middle C (C4). Because Humdrum tools deal with input and output predictably in compliance with the design of UNIX, researchers can make use of the features of the `bash` shell to build data processing pipelines consisting of successive applications of command-line tools to the score files. This is achieved using the `|` (pipe) operator.

The function `get_viola_part` takes one argument, referenced in the function body as `score`.\n\nThe second block starts with the use of Python's `for` enumeration syntax, and consists of actions repeated for over the contents of the `score.parts` attribute. For each `part` in the `score.parts` attribute, the clef for the each part is extracted. `part` refers to a `music21.part.Part` object, which includes references to subordinate objects, such as clefs, barlines, notes, and rests. These subordinate objects are stored in a tree-like, hierarchical structure which must be traversed to extract the desired clef elements. This is the purpose of the `recurse()` method call. This returns an object which does have a clef property, and this is assigned to the `part_clef` variable. \n\nLastly, an `if` statement checks the clef is of the type specified by the `music21.clef.AltoClef` class, using the built-in `type()` function. If this condition is true, the code in the block (the third and final block) directly below the `if` statement is executed. This ability to assess the type of the object at interpretation time is a basic form of introspection, a powerful feature of Python. \n\nIf the `part_clef` extracted from the `part` is indeed an alto clef, iteration ends and a reference to `part` is returned. If no matching part is found, the `if` condition is never satisfied, so the `return part` statement is never called. Iteration through `score.parts` ends, and the function continues to the next statement in the same block (same indentation level) as the `for` statement which began the iteration in the first instance. Accordingly, the function execution terminates and returns `None`.

The result of this function call is assigned to a new `viola_part` variable. Next, we instantiate a new `music21.pitch.Pitch` object, with the pitch `A4` and assign it to a new variable `VIOLA_A_STRING`. Variable names in Python are case-sensitive. A popular convention is to choose upper-case variable names for variables which are not expected to be modified. Thus, `VIOLA_A_STRING` serves as a convenience for later used.\n\nAn empty `list` called `observed` is initialized, to which the one of the following three strings will be added: 'HI', if a pitch equaling or higher than the A string is observed; 'LO', if lower; and 'OTHER', otherwise. (Compare with the use of the `recode` tool from the Humdrum toolkit above.) This behavior is achieved by iterating through the items in the `viola_part.pitches` property, and testing for a series of conditions, in the `if...elif...else` construct. The conditions are expressed using the comparison operators `>=` and `<` (greater than or equal to and less than, respectively). \n\n> Compare with the use of the `semits` and the `recode` tools in the Humdrum example. In `music21`, the comparison of the two pitches is done in a single line. With Humdrum, the score must be transformed from one representation to another (from `**kern` to `**semits`) before it can be used with the `recode` tool.\n\nThis example shows how the conventional meanings of Python operators---the meaning of `<` in the expression `3 < 4`---may be \"overloaded\" to capture the relationship between user-defined or third-party objects, such as `music21.pitch.Pitch`. Behind the scenes, `music21` compares the pitch space representations of each of the two compared pitches. This encourages readable code. A hypothetical alternative, but more verbose, style of implementing this feature could have been used by `music21`: `first_pitch.isGreaterThan(second_pitch)`.
